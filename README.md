# TILs_Analysis
## This repository incldues all the codes I developed for TILs detection and related analysis. 

### Notes
(1) If you only want to use my trained TILs detector to detect tils regions in the WSI, you can directly run and learn examples provided in the link: https://github.com/hwanglab/wsi_deploy_models

(2) If you want to check the process how to train tils detecors, it would involve multiple steps: 
    (i) I downloaded and used the training dataset from the paper: "Spatial Organization and Molecular Correlation of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes Using Deep Learning on Pathology Images". You probably need to read and understand the dataset from this paper.
